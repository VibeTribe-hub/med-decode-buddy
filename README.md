npm: Version 10.x or later (tested with 11.5.1)
Git: For cloning the repository

Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/VibeTribe-hub/med-decode-buddy.git
cd med-decode-buddy


Install Dependencies:
npm install


This installs Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Firebase, Genkit, and other dependencies listed in package.json.


Add Static Assets:

Create a public/images/ folder in the project root.
Download a medical-themed background image (e.g., from Unsplash) and save it as public/images/medical-bg.jpg.
This image is used in the hero section (src/app/page.tsx) and/or globally (src/app/layout.tsx).


Configure Environment Variables:

Create a .env.local file in the project root.
Add Firebase and Genkit configuration (e.g., API keys, project IDs). Example:NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
# Add other Firebase/Genkit keys as needed


Refer to Firebase and Genkit documentation for details.


Run the Development Server:
npm run dev


Starts the Next.js server on http://localhost:9002 (configured with --turbopack for faster builds).
If Turbopack causes issues, edit package.json to use standard Next.js:"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev -p 9002",
  ...
}




Access the App:

Open http://localhost:9002 in your browser.
Verify the medical background image in the hero section or across all pages.

Customization

Background Image:
The app uses a medical-themed background (public/images/medical-bg.jpg) in:
Hero Section: Configured in src/app/page.tsx with a gradient overlay for readability.
Global Background (optional): Set in src/app/layout.tsx with Tailwind classes (bg-[url('/images/medical-bg.jpg')] bg-cover bg-center bg-fixed).


To change the image, replace public/images/medical-bg.jpg and update references in page.tsx or layout.tsx.


Styling: Modify src/app/globals.css or tailwind.config.js for custom colors, fonts, or themes.
Accessibility: Ensure text contrast meets WCAG standards (test with WAVE).

Building for Production
npm run build
npm run start


Builds the app in production mode and starts the server.
Deploy to Vercel, Firebase Hosting, or another platform.

Troubleshooting
Error: 'next' is not recognized:
Delete node_modules and package-lock.json, then run npm install.
Verify Node.js and npm versions:node -v  # Should show v20.x or later
npm -v   # Should show v10.x or later

Try running without Turbopack: Update package.json to "dev": "next dev -p 9002".

Image Not Loading:
Ensure public/images/medical-bg.jpg exists.
Test the image URL: http://localhost:9002/images/medical-bg.jpg.


Text Readability:
Adjust the gradient overlay in page.tsx (hero) or layout.tsx (global):<div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-t from-background/80 to-background/20" />
